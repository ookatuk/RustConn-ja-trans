//! Overlay-based colored highlight rendering for VTE terminals.
//!
//! VTE's `match_add_regex()` only shows underlines on hover — it does not
//! support custom foreground/background colors.  This module draws colored
//! rectangles and underlines on a transparent `gtk4::DrawingArea` layered
//! on top of the terminal via `gtk4::Overlay`.
//!
//! A background rule tints the whole cell behind the match; a foreground rule
//! draws a thick underline in its colour. The overlay paints on a transparent
//! layer above VTE and cannot recolour VTE's own glyphs, so the rule editors
//! call the foreground colour the *underline* colour: recolouring the text
//! itself takes an output filter such as `chromaterm`, which rewrites the stream
//! before VTE sees it (issue #343).
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! [`HighlightOverlay::attach`] creates the `DrawingArea`, puts it on the
//! `gtk4::Overlay` that hosts the terminal, and repaints it whenever VTE's text,
//! cursor or cell size changes, the view scrolls or is resized, or the display
//! scale changes. On each paint it reads the visible text via
//! `terminal.text_range_format()`, runs [`CompiledHighlightRules::find_matches`]
//! per line, and draws colored rectangles (background) and underlines
//! (foreground) using Cairo, clipped to the character grid.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle (issue #343)
//!
//! A session's terminal moves — into a split pane, into a detached window and
//! back — and every move wraps it in a different `gtk4::Overlay`. The drawing
//! layer follows it: whenever the terminal is mapped, the layer re-homes itself
//! on the overlay that hosts the terminal now. Pinned to the overlay it was
//! first attached to, it used to vanish after a detach and never appear in a
//! split pane.
//!
//! The value owns everything it adds. Dropping it takes the layer off its
//! overlay, disconnects the signal handlers it put on the terminal and on the
//! terminal's scroll adjustment, and unregisters the hover regexes it was
//! handed, so replacing a session's rules — on reconnect, or after Settings
//! change — no longer stacks a second layer, a second set of handlers and a
//! second set of regexes on the first.
//!
//! ## Coordinate system (issues #154, #343)
//!
//! VTE uses a single buffer-coordinate system that spans the full scrollback
//! plus the visible viewport.  `text_range_format(0, 0, row_count, col_count)`
//! reads the **first** `row_count` rows of the entire buffer — this is only
//! the visible viewport when the scrollback is empty.  After `clear` (which
//! pushes the previous screen into scrollback before erasing the visible
//! area), rows `0..row_count` become the oldest scrollback lines that still
//! contain the original colored text, while the visible viewport now lives
//! at `[vadjustment.value() .. vadjustment.value() + row_count)`.
//!
//! The fix: anchor the read range to the current viewport top
//! (`vadjustment.value()`), so highlights are computed for the lines that
//! VTE is actually painting at any given moment — as long as VTE has dropped
//! no scrollback yet (see Limitations).
//!
//! That value counts rows but need not be a whole number: touchpad scrolling
//! and a drag on the scrollbar leave the view between two rows, and VTE keeps
//! it there. It then draws buffer row `r` with its top edge
//! `r * char_height - round(value * char_height)` pixels below the top of its
//! grid (`row_to_pixel()` in `vte.cc`, the same in 0.80.5 and 0.84), so the top
//! row is cut part-way and one more row shows at the bottom. [`viewport_rows`]
//! repeats that arithmetic. Truncating the value to whole rows, as the layer
//! used to, put every highlight in such a view up to a row below its text and
//! left the bottom row bare (issue #343).
//!
//! Repaints do not wait for `contents-changed` when the view moves. VTE queues
//! that signal behind its own update cycle when the view scrolls, and emits
//! none when a resize moves the rows (see `vte_contract_tests` in
//! `terminal/mod.rs`), which left the highlights on the old rows until the next
//! output. The layer repaints on the adjustment's own `value-changed` and
//! `changed` signals instead, and when the display scale changes.
//!
//! ## Cell geometry (issue #343)
//!
//! Cell size comes from VTE's own `char_width()`/`char_height()`, not from
//! dividing the DrawingArea by the row/column count (which spread the slack over
//! every column and drifted). The grid starts at the top-left of VTE's *content*
//! box, which [`grid_origin`] maps into the DrawingArea's coordinates. That
//! absorbs the scrollbar beside the terminal and VTE's own CSS padding (1px by
//! default), both of which an origin derived from the DrawingArea or from VTE's
//! border box got wrong. Measured against VTE 0.84 by rendering a full block to
//! a texture: the block's first pixel is exactly at the content-box origin. The
//! Flatpak bundles VTE 0.80.5, which was not measured; its source places the
//! grid the same way, at the start of both axes (`xalign` and `yalign` default
//! to start), with any spare pixels left at the right and bottom.
//! Byte offsets are turned into columns with [`byte_offset_to_column`], which
//! counts a wide (CJK) glyph as two cells, a combining mark as zero and a tab up
//! to the next tab stop.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! - [`byte_offset_to_column`] approximates Unicode width over the common CJK,
//!   kana, Hangul, fullwidth and emoji ranges; a rarer wide block, or a
//!   multi-scalar emoji sequence (ZWJ / regional-indicator pairs) counted per
//!   scalar, can still place a highlight a cell off. Tabs assume VTE's default
//!   stop every eight columns.
//! - In a scrolled-back view VTE also paints into the spare pixels below its
//!   last whole row (`yfill`, on by default) when the terminal's height is not
//!   a whole number of rows. The layer is clipped to whole rows, so a highlight
//!   in that sliver of less than a row is cut short.
//! - When VTE scrolls by itself (mouse wheel, touchpad over the terminal) it
//!   moves its own view first and hands the new position to the adjustment
//!   from its update cycle, so the layer can trail the text for a frame until
//!   `value-changed` arrives. The adjustment is the only public read of the
//!   scroll position.
//! - VTE's adjustment counts from the oldest row it still keeps
//!   (`notify_scroll_value_changed()` in `widget.cc`, 0.76 and 0.80.5), while
//!   `text_range_format()` takes absolute rows. The two agree until VTE drops
//!   scrollback — the scrollback limit is reached, or `clear` sends `ESC [3J` —
//!   after which the layer reads rows as many lines too early as were dropped.
//!   No public VTE API reports that offset. Read from the source, not yet
//!   reproduced.
